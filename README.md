Description:
------------
This project implements the "Bubbles App" assignment using only plain HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (no third-party libraries).

Both Module 1 and Module 2 are implemented within a single file (bubbles.html):

1. Module 1:
   - Draws 4 circles on the left side of the canvas, each filled with a different color.
   - Draws arrows on the right side of the canvas corresponding to each circle.
   - All shapes are rendered inside a single <canvas> element.

2. Module 2:
   - When a user clicks inside a circle, the arrow corresponding to that circle starts moving toward it.
   - Once the arrow hits the circle, the circle changes its color.
   - A "Reset" button is provided to restore the application to its initial state.

Additional Features:
--------------------
- Added subtle grid background and labels ("Circles" and "Arrows") for clarity.
- Circle glow effect when hit for better visual feedback.
- Responsive scaling for accurate click detection.
- Clean UI with styled container and reset button.

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open `bubbles.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - Either double-click the file, or open it via the browser’s File → Open option.
2. Click inside any circle to launch the corresponding arrow.
3. Observe that the circle changes color once hit.
4. Use the "Reset" button to return to the initial state.

Notes:
------
- No external libraries or frameworks were used.
- The app was tested in Chrome and Firefox to ensure consistent behavior.
- The code is self-contained in a single file for easy evaluation.
